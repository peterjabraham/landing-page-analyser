### What I've Added:

	* Configured Tailwind to use Inter as the primary font
**2** **Intuitive Step-by-Step Process**:
	* Added a visual step indicator that shows the current progress (Upload → Results)
	* Clear section headings and visual cues to guide users through the workflow
**3** **Enhanced File Upload Experience**:
	* Created a drag-and-drop file upload zone with visual feedback
	* Added clear instructions and expectations about file format
**4** **Tooltips for Guidance**:
	* Implemented tooltips using Radix UI's tooltip component
	* Added helpful tooltips to explain each field and action
	* Tooltips provide context without cluttering the interface
**5** **Improved Visual Feedback**:

	* Download button prominently positioned for easy access
**7** **Enhanced Data Processing**:

⠀How to Use the Application:
**1** **Upload & Configure Stage**:
